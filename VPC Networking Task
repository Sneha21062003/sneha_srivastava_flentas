I created one VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 for enough private IP space.

Added 2 public subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24) and 2 private subnets (10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24).

Public subnets are for internet-facing resources. Private subnets are for internal resources.

Attached an Internet Gateway to give public subnets internet access.

Created a NAT Gateway in Public Subnet 1 so private subnets can reach the internet safely.

Updated route tables:

Public → IGW

Private → NAT

Chose /24 ranges because they are simple, clean, and easy to manage.

Added screenshots of VPC, subnets, route tables, IGW, and NAT in my report.
