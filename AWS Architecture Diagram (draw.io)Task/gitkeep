I designed a scalable web application architecture using a multi-AZ setup for high availability.
Traffic first passes through the Internet Gateway and AWS WAF, then reaches the Application Load Balancer. 
The ALB distributes requests across EC2 instances placed in an Auto Scaling Group inside private subnets.
A Multi-AZ RDS database handles persistent storage, and ElastiCache (Redis) accelerates read performance.
Public subnets host load balancing and outbound traffic, while private subnets secure application and database layers.
CloudWatch collects logs and metrics for monitoring and operational visibility.
