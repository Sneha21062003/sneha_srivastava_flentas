1. Brief explanation of your HA architecture and traffic flow

I created an Internet-facing Application Load Balancer placed in two public subnets to ensure the app stays reachable even if one Availability Zone fails.
The Auto Scaling Group runs EC2 instances inside private subnets for better security and launches them across multiple AZs.
The ALB receives all incoming traffic and forwards it to the target group, which contains only the EC2 instances managed by the ASG. 
If any instance fails or load increases, the ASG automatically replaces or adds new ones. This setup keeps the application highly available, scalable, and 
protected inside private subnets.
